# About

- This repo is an extension for the Anki app called Anki Smart Notes. 
- Anki Smart Notes adds functionality to Anki to allow fields to be AI generated. This works for both text, audio, and images.


# Code Style and Practices
- Follow existing practices and conventions in the codebase.
- Use modern Python. Make sure your code is fully typed.
- Always run format, lint, typecheck, and tests as the last thing you do. This is super important.
- Use `./scripts/build.sh check` to run all code quality checks (format, lint, typecheck)
- Use `./scripts/build.sh typecheck` to run only type checking
- Use `./scripts/build.sh fix` to automatically fix formatting and linting issues
- Always put imports at the top of files, never inside functions or methods 

# Testing
- Always check for existing test patterns and follow them consistently.
- Always run tests after writing code and before submitting PRs to ensure you didn't break anything. 
- Always reuse existing test fixtures and mocks instead of creating new ones. 

# PRs
- Prefix PRs with one of either `feat:` (new feature), `fix:` (fix a bug), `refactor:` (refactor an existing feature), or `chore:` (fixing lint, upgrading deps, tests, etc). Keep titles concise. For example: `feat: implement new MegaSqueek TTS model`.
- When you are told to fix PR comments, you should mark them as resolved when they are done. 
- You should be very careful that you actually look at every PR comment. Don't let them slip through.
- We use `Linear` for issue tracking: if you see text like [ANK-123] somewhere, like in your prompt or a Github issue title , the PR should include that text `[ANK-123]` at the end of the title. Example: `fix: double sign out bug [ANK-1337]`
- Branches should contain the Linear tag if you are provided one as well. Names should be concise, for example: `fix-sign-out-bug-ank-1337`

# Permissions
- If you're in accept edits mode, don't ask for permission to git commit or git push. Just do it.

# Code Structure
- This is a Python3 codebase which takes full advantage of strong typing for static analysis.
- UI specific code lives in `src/ui`
- The code entry point is `main.py` â†’ `hooks.py`, which sets up the Anki UI and initializes key classes.

## Key Architecture Components

### Entry Point & Flow
- **`main.py`**: Entry point that creates `NoteProcessor` and calls `setup_hooks()` 
- **`hooks.py`**: Sets up all Anki UI hooks, menu items, buttons, and context menus. Initializes logging, config, and migrations. Contains the main UI integration logic.

### Core Processing Classes
- **`NoteProcessor`** (`note_proccessor.py`): Main orchestrator for processing notes/cards. Handles batch processing, single card processing, and manages the DAG execution flow.
- **`FieldProcessor`** (`field_processor.py`): Handles individual field processing based on type (chat, TTS, image). Routes to appropriate providers and handles response formatting.
- **`AppStateManager`** (`app_state.py`): Manages subscription state, capacity limits, and app unlock status. Handles transitions between subscription states.

### Field Processing System  
- **`dag.py`**: Creates Directed Acyclic Graph for field dependencies. Handles topological sorting and cycle detection for smart fields that reference other fields.
- **`nodes.py`**: `FieldNode` class representing individual fields in the DAG with dependencies, processing state, and metadata.
- **`prompts.py`**: Prompt interpolation, field extraction from prompts, and prompt management per note type/deck.

### Data Models & Configuration
- **`models.py`**: Type definitions for:
  - Chat/TTS/Image providers and models 
  - `SmartFieldType` ("chat", "tts", "image")
  - `FieldExtras` configuration per field
  - Provider/model mappings
- **`config.py`**: Global configuration management with persistence
- **`constants.py`**: Error messages, limits, and static values

### Provider Classes
- **`chat_provider.py`**: Handles OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek chat completions
- **`tts_provider.py`**: Text-to-speech via OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Google
- **`image_provider.py`**: Image generation via Replicate (Flux models)
- **`open_ai_client.py`**: Legacy OpenAI client for users with API keys

### UI System (`src/ui/`)
- **Reactive Components**: Base classes for reactive UI widgets that update automatically
- **`addon_options_dialog.py`**: Main settings dialog
- **`field_menu.py`**: Context menu for individual fields 
- **`state_manager.py`**: Generic state management for UI components
- **Dialog Components**: Various specialized dialogs for prompts, subscriptions, etc.

### Utilities
- **`notes.py`**: Note type utilities, field validation, AI field detection
- **`decks.py`**: Deck-related utilities and caching
- **`utils.py`**: General utilities, async helpers, field extraction
- **`media_utils.py`**: Media file path generation for TTS/images
