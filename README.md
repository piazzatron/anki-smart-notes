  ... so many more!

## Features

### Multiple ways to generate cards:

- **Automatically generate fields at review time** (perfect if you import your anki cards from another app like Yomichan.)
  - <video>
- Regenerate individual fields or the entire card to your heart's content
- Process multiple notes with lightning fast batch processing. _Whole deck processing coming soon_

- Use any OpenAI model, from the newest gpt-4o to cheapest 3.5-turbo
- Create complex prompts: smart fields can reference as many other fields on your card as you like.

Smart Notes was initially inspired by <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1416178071">Intellifiller</a>, which is no longer supported in current Anki versions.

## Instructions

**Installation**
Restart Anki once you've installed the add-on. You will need an <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">OpenAI API key.</a>

**Cost** (to OpenAI, not to me)
Free users can use gpt-3.5-turbo but are limited to 3 requests/min.

For paid users, <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">prices are per token</a> - expect to pay a few tenths of a penny per call, but YMMV.
