**Use any OpenAI model**
From the newest gpt-4o to cheapest 3.5-turbo

**Create complex prompts**
Smart fields can reference as many other fields on your card as you like.

_Smart Notes was initially inspired by <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1416178071">Intellifiller</a>, which is sadly no longer supported in current Anki versions._

## Additional Info

**Installation**
Restart Anki once you've installed the add-on. You will need an <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">OpenAI API key.</a>

**Cost** (to OpenAI, not to me)
Free users can use gpt-3.5-turbo but are limited to 3 requests/min.

For paid users, <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">prices are per token</a> - expect to pay a few tenths of a penny per call, but YMMV.
